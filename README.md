<p>I'm Elwyn Ynion, a self-taught UI/UX designer and full-stack web developer. I started learning HTML and utilizing CSS when I was in ninth school and I enjoy learning new skills as time goes on. I am keen on using my different experiences to solve complex issues and design engaging experiences. I honed my skills in product design, technical writing, web programming, and app development. I build a website with HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript and design using Bootstrap, Bulma and Tailwind and now I build a website using NextJS. When I’m not coding, I’m playing online games or doing some personal stuff. Now I am a Computer Science Student pursuing my dream to become a software engineer.</p><br/>
